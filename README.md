👋🏽 Hi, I’m Tiffany — a self-taught cybersecurity learner currently studying in CUNY tech upskilling initiative.

I’m focused on building hands-on skills in:

- 🔐 Cybersecurity (CompTIA A+, Security+ topics)
- 🧠 Linux and command-line tools
- 🏗️ OT/ICS frameworks like Purdue Model & NIST 800-82
- 🤖 AI fundamentals (CUNY AI course completed)

This GitHub documents my journey — from practical labs to written notes — as I prepare for a remote role in IT or cybersecurity support.

_Repo updated weekly. Everything is beginner-friendly, real, and focused on progress._
